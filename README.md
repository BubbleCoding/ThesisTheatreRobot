# ThesisTheatreRobot

This is the source code of my thesis project. Not the cleanest code I wrote, but its functional and rather fast.

At the end of August this 2021, I finished my Bachelor Thesis. I had to wait some time to receive my diploma but that moment is almost upon me.
For my Bachelor thesis, I set the first step towards a robot-actor for Theater Sonnevanck. This was an awesome project and I loved working with the client and really appreciated the involvement of the client.

Abstract:
Robots in theatre are a new and upcoming concept
which bring their own very unique challenges. The theatre group Sonnevanck is in need of a robot-actor for their upcoming traveling children theatre show. This graduation project aims to explore the possibilities for robot-actors and to figure out what the design criteria are for Sonnevanck’s robot. This is done through several unique experiments and through the building of a prototype. Sonnevanck wants a robot that is emotionally expressive, capable of singing with the same quality as a human and can interact with the world. Furthermore, the robot is fully controlled by an actor who is the voice of the robot as well. This graduation project provides a host of design criteria and recommendations to be used to build Sonnevanck’s robot-actor.
